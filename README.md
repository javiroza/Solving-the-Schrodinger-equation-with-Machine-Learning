# Solving the Deuteron

Main program: deuteron_ansatz_wavefunction.py

This program trains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to compute a physical wavefunction: the two bound states
of the Deuteron. Starting from a 'blank' ANN with 4Nhid parameters and a single hidden layer, we use it as the trial 
wavefunction in a Rayleigh-Ritz minimisation scheme, with the parameters being the 4Nhid ANN parameters. This 
program is the first step towards the energy minimisation: we train the ANN to take the form of an ansatz physical 
wavefunction to start with, and we do so by maximising the overlap of the ANN and the ansatz function.
